        <p>My project deals with displaying the nutritional breakdown of food items from two very famous fast food chains. I collected two datasets that provide nutritional analysis of all the food items on McDonald’s and Burger Kings’ menu. McDonalds and Burger are two of the most famous and largest fast food restaurant chains serving in so many countries across the world. Both of them are famous for their burger and fries and have a very diverse customer base. Almost everybody in the United States eats at either of the joints.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though they are very famous fast food chains, they receive a lot of backlash because of their unhealthy food options. I feel this dataset can be used to make slightly healthier choices while ordering at these fast food joint. This dataset can be used to sort out food based on user's need, be it overall calories, or amount of carbohydrates, or amount of protein etc. It can be used to make food choices based on someone's daily nutritional requirement. It can be used to compare items from McDonald’s to items from Burger King. It will be useful for anyone who goes to or orders from McDonald's or Burger King in making a healthy food choice.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The visualization is spread over two pages: the nutritional analysis page and the nutritional comparison page. The nutritional analysis page contains two tables that display the nutritional value of all the items on the menu of McDonald and Burger King. The columns can be sorted based on ascending or descending values and can also be filtered as per the user’s requirement. The nutritional comparison page contains comparative donut chart for food on McDonald’s and Burger King’s menu. Two dropdowns are provided to select items from both the menu’s respectively. As both the fast food chains have a very similar menu, the user will be able to compare option from both the menus side by side.</p>
